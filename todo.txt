--------------------------
Step 4: Parse the header
--------------------------

Go line by line.

Detect resolution (R), textures (NO, SO, WE, EA), and colors (F, C).

Store values in your t_cub struct.

Skip empty lines.

--------------------------
Step 5: Parse the mapw
--------------------------

Detect first map line using is_map_line().

Store all subsequent map lines in t_map.grid.

Compute width and height.

Detect the player position (N, S, E, W) and save in t_player.

Pad shorter lines with spaces.

Validate that map contains exactly one player.

After parsing, you can validate map walls (optional next step).
