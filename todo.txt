--------------------------
Step 4: Parse the header
--------------------------

Go line by line.

Detect resolution (R), textures (NO, SO, WE, EA), and colors (F, C).

Store values in your t_cub struct.

Skip empty lines.

--------------------------
Step 5: Parse the mapw
--------------------------

Once you reach the first line that looks like a map (1s and 0s), start storing it.

Use a dynamic array or linked list first, then convert to a 2D char ** array.

Detect player start position (N/S/E/W) and store it in t_player.

--------------------------
Step 6: Validate the map
--------------------------

Make sure the map is surrounded by walls.

Make sure thereâ€™s exactly one player start.

Check for invalid characters.
